# NYC Subway Turnstile Data

For our first project at Metis, we were split into teams and given the task of helping a company called WomenTechWomenYes gain exposure by collecting email addresses on the streets of New York City.

Using subway turnstile data from the MTA, my group and I performed some exploratory data analysis to make recommendations as to when & where WomenTechWomenYes should place street teams in order to collect the most emails and invite the most people to their event.

Our analysis included trying to account for the large tourist presence in New York City, and strategies we could employ to ensure that WomenTechWomenYes connected with local New Yorkers rather than visitors from out of town.
