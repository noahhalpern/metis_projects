# Metis Projects

This repository contains the code for the 5 projects I completed as a student at Metis Data Science Bootcamp from January-March 2020.

## A brief overview of my projects

**1. [NYC subway turnstile EDA](./nyc_subway)**

* Performing exploratory data analysis on New York City subway traffic data to help a non-profit gain interest and exposure around the city.

**2. [Predicting soccer player transfer fees](./soccer_transfer_fees)**

* Using linear regression to predict European soccer player transfer costs based on their in-game stats from the season prior to their transfer.

**3. [Thanksgiving Flight Delays](./flight_delays)**

* Predicting flight delays using air traffic and weather data in a random forest model.

**4. Towards Data Science Article Text Analysis**

* Topic modeling on Towards Data Science articles to see what makes a good article and what kinds of content readers are looking for.

**5. Modeling NHL shots & goal probabilities to develop new metrics for goalie performance**
