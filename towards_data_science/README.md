# Towards Data Science Article Text Analysis

For this project I analyzed over 10,000 articles from Towards Data Science (TDS) to see what kinds of articles are being published on the site, and if they are publishing content that is interesting/valuable to readers.

To do this analysis, I performed topic modeling on the articles to group them into distinct topic categories. I then compared the number of articles in each category with the number of claps (likes) articles in each category received.

I found that the topics generally fell into two groups. One group had two topics which both had lots of articles and also received lots of claps. The other group received similar numbers of claps to the first, but contained fewer articles. As a result, I concluded that TDS should focus on publishing more content on the topics in the second group, because there is a more limited supply of articles in these areas.
